     *
     * Do I need to make a distinction between the implementation of these objects and the way the metadata is gathered?
     * currently, an impl'n of MappingConfiguration will need to do the lookup of mapping metadata for a given class, which is
     * functionality, and also provide the object creation strategy, which is configuration.
     *
     * Given the class is called "configuration", I reckon this may actually be a sub-standard design.  Let's have a look at how
     * we'd build one of these.
