/**
 * This object is partially hydrated via its setter methods and partially via its fields
 *
 * A Satellite can be logically active or inactive. However this is not determined by
 * an attribute on the node, but instead by the relationship-type to the space program
 * that launched it (program)-[:ACTIVE]->(satellite) or (program-[:INACTIVE]-(satellite).
 *
 * The requirement to assign boolean attributes from the presence of absence of a relationship
 * between two nodes is a long-standing one. Currently no solution exists. One possibility
 * would be to add a new attribute @Infer. This would only apply to Boolean fields
 * and their related getters/setters, for example:
 *
 * @Infer(relationshipType="ACTIVE") Boolean active;
 *
 * Does the absence of an 'ACTIVE' relationship imply 'INACTIVE' and therefore active=False?
