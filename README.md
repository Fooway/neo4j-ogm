Spring Data Neo4j (v.Future)
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neo4j/neo4j-ogm.png)](https://travis-ci.org/neo4j/neo4j-ogm)

This repository contains a brand new object-graph mapping (OGM) framework for [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com) and the next version of [Spring Data
Neo4j (SDN)](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/), developed by [GraphAware](http://www.graphaware.com). It is a complete re-write of SDN and it is designed for
efficiency with Neo4j server-mode deployments. Cypher over HTTP is used exclusively as means of communication with the database.

This OGM is usable without any dependencies on Spring.

Note that this project is in a pre-milestone stage, so treat the repo as such.

The code for this project has moved!
====================================
This repo is not currently being actively maintained, for operational reasons. So it may be out
of date, and you shouldn't expect it to be supported in any way.

This is a temporary situation, and this notice will be removed when the project is back
under active maintenance in this repository.

Until then, if you need the latest version of Neo4j-OGM, you can find it here:
