Spring Data Neo4j (v.Future)
============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neo4j/neo4j-ogm.png)](https://travis-ci.org/neo4j/neo4j-ogm)

This repository contains a brand new object-graph mapping (OGM) framework for [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com) and the next version of [Spring Data
Neo4j (SDN)](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-neo4j/), developed by [GraphAware](http://www.graphaware.com). It is a complete re-write of SDN and it is designed for
efficiency with Neo4j server-mode deployments. Cypher over HTTP is used exclusively as means of communication with the database.

This OGM is usable without any dependencies on Spring.

Note that this project is in a pre-milestone stage, so treat the repo as such.
