Object-Graph Mapping for Neo4j
==============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neo4j/neo4j-ogm.png)](https://travis-ci.org/neo4j/neo4j-ogm)

## Introduction

This repository contains a brand new object-graph mapping (OGM) framework for Neo4j and the next version of Spring Data
Neo4j (SDN), developed by http://www.graphaware.com[GraphAware]. It is a complete re-write of SDN and it is designed for
efficiency with Neo4j server-mode deployments. Cypher over HTTP is used exclusively as means of communication with the database.

This OGM is usable without any dependencies on Spring.

Note that this project is in a pre-milestone stage, so treat the repo as such.
