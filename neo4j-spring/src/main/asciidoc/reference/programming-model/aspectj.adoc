= Advanced Mapping with AspectJ

Behind the scenes, Spring Data Neo4j leverages http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/[AspectJ] aspects to modify the behavior of annotated POJO entities (see <<reference_aspectj-details>>). Each node entity is backed by a graph node that holds its properties and relationships to other entities. AspectJ is used for intercepting field access, so that Spring Data Neo4j can retrieve the appropriate information from the entity's backing node or relationship.

The aspect introduces an internal field (`entityState`) and some public methods (see <<reference_programming-model_introduced-methods>>) to the entities, for instance `entity.getPersistentState()` and `entity.relateTo`. It also introduces some methods for graph operations that start at the current entity. Introduced methods for `equals()` and `hashCode()` use the underlying node or relationship. Please take the introduced field into account when serializing your entities and exclude it from the serialization process.

Spring Data Neo4j internally uses an abstraction called `EntityState` that the field access and instantiation advices of the aspect delegate to. This way, the aspect code is kept to a minimum, focusing mainly on the pointcuts and delegation. The `EntityState` then uses a number of `FieldAccessorFactories` to create a `FieldAccessor` instance per field that does the specific handling needed for the concrete field type. There is some caching involved as well, so it handles repeated instantiation efficiently.

To use the advanced, AspectJ based mapping, please add `spring-data-neo4j-aspects` as a dependency and set up the AspectJ integration in Maven or other build tools as explained in <<setup>>. Some hints for your IDE setup are described below.

== AspectJ IDE support

As Spring Data Neo4j uses some advanced features of AspectJ, users may experience issues with their IDE reporting errors where in fact there are none. Features that might be reported wrongfully include: introduction of methods to interfaces, declaration of additional interfaces for annotated classes, and generified introduced methods.

IDEs not providing full AspectJ support might mark parts of your code as having errors. You should rely on your build-system and tests to verify the correctness of the code. You might also have your Entities (or their interfaces) implement the `NodeBacked` and `RelationshipBacked` interfaces directly to benefit from completion support and error checking.

Eclipse and STS support AspectJ via the AJDT plugin which can be installed from the update-site listed at http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/[http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/downloads/] (it might be necessary to use the latest development snapshot of the plugin). The current version that does not show incorrect errors is AspectJ 1.6.12 (included in STS 2.8.0), previous versions are reported to mislead the user. Note that AJDT (as of September 2012) requires projects to be rebuild after Eclipse is started to fully support all advanced features.

NOTE: There might be some issues with the eclipse maven plugin not adding AspectJ files correctly to the build path. If you encounter issues, please try the following: Try editing the build path to `+include **/*.aj+` for the spring-data-neo4j-aspects project. You can do this by selecting "Build Path -> Configure Build Path ..." from the Package Explorer. Then for the `spring-data-neo4j-aspects/src/main/java` add `**/*.aj` to the Included path. When importing a Spring Data Neo4j project into Eclipse with m2e, please make sure the AspectJ Configurator is  installed from the following update-site: http://dist.springsource.org/release/AJDT/configurator[http://dist.springsource.org/release/AJDT/configurator]

The AspectJ support in IntelliJ IDEA lacks some of the features. JetBrains is working on improving the situation in their upcoming 11 release of their popular IDE. Their latest work is available under their early access program (EAP). Building the project with the AspectJ compiler `ajc` works in IDEA (Options -> Compiler -> Java Compiler should show ajc). Make sure to give the compiler at least 512 MB of RAM.
