= Indexing

Indexing is used in Neo4j to quickly find nodes and relationships from which to start graph operations. Either for manually traversing the graph, using the traversal framework, cypher queries or for "global" graph operations. Indexes are also employed to ensure uniqueness of elements with certain labels and properties.

NOTE: Please note that the lucene-based manual indexes are deprecated with Neo4j 2.0. The default index is now based on labels and schema indexes and the related old APIs have been deprecated as well. The "legacy" index framework should only be used for fulltext and spatial indexes which are not currently supported via schema-based indexes.

== Index Management in Spring Data Neo4j 4

From Spring Data Neo4j 4, `@Indexed` no longer exists.  The reason for this is because index creation should not be the job of the mapping framework, but should instead be managed within the database environment and tuned for the particular use case of your application.  Indexes shouldn't be added arbitrarily to fields by developers, but should instead be the result of design decisions made alongside the rest of the performance requirements.

Index creation and management is therefore now outside the scope of this document.  Please see the Neo4j documention on indexes for for information:  http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/query-schema-index.html

== Index queries in Neo4jTemplate

For querying on indexes, certainly as of SDN 4 milestone one, your best bet is to take advantage of the `GraphRepository` load-by-property methods, or the corresponding ones on `Neo4jTemplate`.  If you know that particular properties are indexed in the database then this will ensure that the indexes are utilised so you still take advantage of the performance benefits.

In the full release, the ability to do this through Spring repositories should also be fully implemented.

== Neo4j Auto Indexes

Neo4j allows to configure (legacy) http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/auto-indexing.html[auto-indexing] for certain properties on nodes and relationships.  It is possible to use the specific index names `node_auto_index` and `relationship_auto_index` when querying indexes in Spring Data Neo4j either with the query methods in template and repositories or via Cypher.

== Spatial Indexes

Spring Data Neo4j offers limited support for spatial queries using the `neo4j-spatial` library. See the separate chapter <<reference_spatial>> for details.
