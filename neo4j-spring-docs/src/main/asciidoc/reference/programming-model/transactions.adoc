= Transactions

Neo4j is a transactional database, only allowing modifications to be performed within transaction boundaries. Reading data does however not require transactions. Spring Data Neo4j integrates nicely with both the declarative transaction support with `@Transactional` as well as the manual transaction handling with `TransactionTemplate`. It also supports the rollback mechanisms of the Spring Testing library.

As of version 4.0, the classes used to perform transaction management have been rewritten.  Instead of using `SpringTransactionManager` provided by the Neo4j kernel alongside Spring's `JtaTransactionManager`, the transaction management is performed by `Neo4jTransactionManager`, which implements Spring's `PlatformTransactionManager`.  
This `Neo4jTransactionManager` is based on an OGM `Session`, on which the `beginTransaction()` method gets called, and this in turn delegates onto the underlying OGM's `TransactionManager` implementation.

The `Neo4jConfiguration` Spring configuration bean will create an instance of this `Neo4jTransactionManager` for use in Spring Data Neo4j.  It is made available under the name "transactionManager" in the Spring application context.

NOTE: Neither XML-based configuration nor multi-resource transactions are supported in SDN 4 M1

For scenarios with multiple transactional resources there are two options. The first option is to have Neo4j participate in the externally-configured transaction manager using the Spring support in Neo4j by enabling the configuration parameter for your graph database. Neo4j will then use Spring's transaction manager instead of its own.

You can also configure a custom XA transaction manager (e.g. Atomikos, JOTM, App-Server-TM) to be used with Neo4j and the other resources. For a bit less secure but fast 1-phase-commit-best-effort, use `ChainedTransactionManager`, which comes bundled with Spring Data Neo4j. It takes a list of transaction managers as constructor params and will handle them in order for transaction start and commit (or rollback) in the reverse order.

NOTE: As of Neo4j 2.2, there is no XA transaction participation support
