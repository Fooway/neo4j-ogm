This tutorial walks through the creation of a complete web application called cineasts.net, built with Spring Data Neo4j. Cineasts are people who love movies, and the site is a gathering place for moviegoers. For cineasts.net we decided to add a social aspect to the rating of movies, allowing friends to share their scores and get recommendations for new friends and movies.

The tutorial takes the reader through the steps necessary to create the application. It provides the configuration and code examples that are needed to understand what's happening in Spring Data Neo4j. The complete source code for the app is available on http://spring.neo4j.org/cineasts[Github].
